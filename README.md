#TARDIS WebApp

This is a demo of my TARDIS proposal. This demo employs Google Charts to plot the spectrum.  
The TARDIS task is run synchronously and its physical quantities are then used for charting.  
Efforts are being put to host it on a free dyno on Heroku.  
All packages have been successfully installed on heroku except h5py.
